- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @rezadoz. I'm a total noob to coding and dev beyond messing around with prebuilt stuff and configs since I was a kid
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ... making friends in this space, becoming better at linux and most tech in general (excluding iOS and androids (idk they just give me the ick)), I want to learn skills for development and coding, my end goal is to become one.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ... python, less basic linux skills, AI tools and development, webserver stuff
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on ... anything just ask
- üì´ How to reach me ... for now... bryan@3palmsrealty.com
- üòÑ Pronouns: Even if you're the complete opposite of my beliefs/opinions/politics/ideology, I won't hold it against you and will treat you like anyone else. I get it, I'm weird too, and I like weird people. So don't hold it against me if I don't know or care what pronouns you prefer. Cause I won't care bout that either ;^)
- ‚ö° Fun fact: ... privacy and cryptography are essential to everyday tech and life as we know it, but it's also really cool in a personal or recreational context

üëáüèª My pgp key if you need to communicate something to me privately.
